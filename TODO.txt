Wander behavior for enemies
Pursuit
Wall Avoidance

*fps independent animation

3)*hostileUnits are in the playfield - agent explodes(animation change) 
on collision, transition to gameOver state
-walls on edges needed.

4)*powerUps spawn at set interval with random pos and doubles the points 
-but has negative effects such as 2x speed on agent
or changes the hostileUnits
-points are acquired depending on how long the player survives

2)-when the player reaches the controlPoint it will circle around it
-controlPoint has an indicator to show it will explode soon. game over if it explodes
*
--it should move in the direction of the controlPoint, but not circle around.
--go past it and despawn the controlPoint

1)*inGame HUD
-fps and high score hud
-pause menu to go back to main menu with high score and game mode selection


***
//calced velX, velY works but makes no sense when using with setLinearVelocity
//-find how to move in the direction ship is looking

**-check getDesiredAngle - math behind that.

-check how Seek behavior actually works and if any other behavior is similar to the one implemented
