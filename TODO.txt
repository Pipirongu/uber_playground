*fps independent animation

*agent uses steering behavior to move in the direction of the spawnUnit

*hostileUnits are in the playfield - agent explodes(animation change) 
on collision, transition to gameOver state
-walls on edges needed.

*powerUps spawn at set interval with random pos and doubles the points 
-but has negative effects such as 2x speed on agent
or changes the hostileUnits
-points are acquired depending on how long the player survives

-when the player reaches the controlPoint it will circle around it
-controlPoint has an indicator to show it will explode soon. game over if it explodes

*inGame HUD
-fps and high score hud
-pause menu to go back to main menu with high score and game mode selection


***
calced velX, velY works but makes no sense when using with setLinearVelocity
-find how to move in the direction ship is looking

-check getDesiredAngle - math behind that.

-check how Seek behavior actually works and if any other behavior is similar to the one implemented
